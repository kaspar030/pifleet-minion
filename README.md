# Introduction

The Pi fleet is a centrally provisioned network of Raspberry Pi's used for
testing / developing the RIOT operating system.  It's main purpose is to
provide both maintainers and the CI system with access to target boards that
might be needed for testing purposes.

# Overview

The fleet consist of a server running a salt master instance that is used to
set up users, networking, ... on a bunch of Raspberry Pis.
This repository contains the scripts and files to set up a Pi fleet base image.

Currently it does the following:

- at first boot, set hostname to "pi-${cpu serial number}"
- install salt-minion, set up pihub.riot-labs.de as master

# How-to

Download and unzip a Raspian image.
Set up qemu-arm-static and binfmt-support.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install -y qemu qemu-user-static binfmt-support
```

Run
```bash
$ sudo ./setup_image.sh <Raspian image>
```
